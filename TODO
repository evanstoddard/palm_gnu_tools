* fix the `-l' gas flag.  (flag_short_refs in md_estimate_size_before_relax()
in binutils/gas/config/tc-m68k.c)  This would let a few patches in gcc's
m68k.md and lb1sf68palmos.asm go away; in particular, getting rid of the
`define_insn "jump"' one would reduce code size, maybe even non-trivially.

* get rid of pilot.ld / palmos_link.ld in favour of a customized set of
scripts in binutils/ld/scripttempl/m68kcoff.sc.  Besides being a bit of a
tidy-up, this would get -r linking going -- not that that's particularly
useful.  (Might need to hack a little just above the base_file stuff in
binutils/bfd/cofflink.c too.)
* maybe try to make the binutils palmos stuff a proper subtarget -- separate
off the machine independent patches to send off to the main binutils
distribution.

* Update the ChangeLogs, and start submitting patches to the various GNU
maintainers (without any of the remaining nasty hacks!).

* sort out GLibs and integrate Michael's stuff.
