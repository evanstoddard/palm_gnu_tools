* fix the `-l' gas flag.  (flag_short_refs in md_estimate_size_before_relax()
in binutils/gas/config/tc-m68k.c)  This would let a few patches in gcc's
m68k.md and lb1sf68palmos.asm go away; in particular, getting rid of the
`define_insn "jump"' one would reduce code size, maybe even non-trivially.

* get rid of pilot.ld / palmos_link.ld in favour of a customized set of
scripts in binutils/ld/scripttempl/m68kcoff.sc.  Besides being a bit of a
tidy-up, this would get -r linking going -- not that that's particularly
useful.  (Might need to hack a little just above the base_file stuff in
binutils/bfd/cofflink.c too.)
* maybe try to make the binutils palmos stuff a proper subtarget -- separate
off the machine independent patches to send off to the main binutils
distribution.

* Update the ChangeLogs, and start submitting patches to the various GNU
maintainers (without any of the remaining nasty hacks!).

* figure out what to do to unify the different floating point implementations.
You can now (finally!) call new float manager routines by hand, but you
probably want them to get called for operators too.  Unfortunately, libcalls
don't see prototypes (i.e., they don't see callseqs!), so there's a bit of
internals hacking needed here.

* get GDB to notice Macsbug function names in the absence of other symbols
(like in the ROM, for example).

* sort out GLibs and integrate Michael's stuff.
