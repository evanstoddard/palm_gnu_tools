			prc-tools version 2.0.92

USING THESE TOOLS

In addition to installing this package, you will also need to install
a Palm OS SDK.  SDK versions 3.5 and greater work with prc-tools without
modification.  Earlier SDKs require changes to work with prc-tools; you
can find suitably modified SDKs in Palm's devzone at
<http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools/gcc/#sdks>.  

You may wish to install several SDKs, and you will probably want to choose
one as the default SDK, to be used when you compile without any `-palmosN'
command line option.  A symbolic link named `sdk' is used to select a
default SDK; for example, to use the 3.5 SDK by default:

	$ cd /opt/palmdev
	$ rm -f sdk
	$ ln -s sdk-3.5 sdk

(On Windows, the default equivalent of /opt/palmdev is C:\PalmDev.)

[THE FOLLOWING WINDOWS INFORMATION IS OUT OF DATE.]

On Windows, you will also have to add the prc-tools bin directory to your
PATH.  You need to add the directory <prc-tools-location>\H-i586-cygwin32\bin.
For example, if you have installed prc-tools in the default place, you could
add the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

	set PATH="C:\Program Files\PRC-Tools\H-i586-cygwin32\bin;%PATH%"

For further documentation, read the info pages for prc-tools, gcc, etc.,
which you can also install as HTML documents at

	file:///C|/PalmDev/doc/index.html	(Windows)
or
	file:/usr/local/palmdev/doc/index.html	(Unix)


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

To build these tools yourself, you will need to download the source from
<http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>.  You will also need the source
for GCC 2.95.3, binutils 2.9.1, and gdb 5.0, which can be found via
<http://www.gnu.org/software/software.html>.  See the file BUILDING.html.


LICENSING

* The patches to the GNU tools in *.palmos.diff and the code in the tools
  subdirectory are free software, and may be redistributed and/or modified
  under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 2, or
  (at your option) any later version.  See the file COPYING.

* The run-time support code in the crt subdirectory is in the public domain,
  and the resulting object code may be freely linked into your programs.

* The code in the libc subdirectory is redistributable as follows:

  libc.a,
  libc.sa
	Small standard C library (static and shared versions).
	Includes type stuff, printf and friends.  putchar()
	and printf() send output to the LCD (even does scrolling!).
	I would not expect this to be terribly useful for anything
	except debugging, or perhaps a terminal program.  String
	functions are also included, as are memmove, bcopy and
	those sorts of things.  Much of this library thanks to
	Linus Torvalds, from the Linux kernel lib directory.  He
	gave me permission to release this stuff _without_ GPL
	encumberance.

* The code in the libm subdirectory is based on the Cephes Math Library
  <http://people.ne.mediaone.net/moshier/index.html> and is freely
  redistributable as follows:

  libm.a
	Single precision math library.  The standard kind of stuff
	(like multiply, add etc) will be included with libgcc.a
	when the compiler was built, this stuff is what one expects
	from a complete libm.a.  This library was ported from
	the Cephes Math Library Release 2.2:  June, 1992 and is
	Copyright 1984, 1987, 1988 by Stephen L. Moshier.  Really
	neet stuff!
