			prc-tools version 2.0.92

USING THESE TOOLS

In addition to installing this package, you will also need to install
a Palm OS SDK.  SDK versions 3.5 and greater work with prc-tools without
modification.  Earlier SDKs require changes to work with prc-tools; you
can find suitably modified SDKs on Palm's web site at
<URL:http://www.palmos.com/dev/tech/tools/gcc/#sdks>.  

You may wish to install several SDKs, and you will probably want to choose
one as the default SDK, to be used when you compile without any `-palmosN'
command line option.  A symbolic link named `sdk' is used to select a
default SDK; for example, to use the 3.5 SDK by default:

	$ cd /opt/palmdev
	$ rm -f sdk
	$ ln -s sdk-3.5 sdk

(On Windows, the default equivalent of /opt/palmdev is C:\PalmDev.)

[THE FOLLOWING WINDOWS INFORMATION IS OUT OF DATE.]

On Windows, you will also have to add the prc-tools bin directory to your
PATH.  You need to add the directory <prc-tools-location>\H-i586-cygwin32\bin.
For example, if you have installed prc-tools in the default place, you could
add the following to your AUTOEXEC.BAT:

	set PATH="C:\Program Files\PRC-Tools\H-i586-cygwin32\bin;%PATH%"

For further documentation, read the info pages for prc-tools, gcc, etc.,
which you can also install as HTML documents at

	file:///C|/PalmDev/doc/index.html	(Windows)
or
	file:/usr/local/palmdev/doc/index.html	(Unix)


QUESTIONS ABOUT PALM OS PROGRAMMING

Especially if you are new to C or new to programming for Palm OS, you may
find that you have questions about problems you encounter while using
prc-tools, and you may be unsure where to ask them.

For questions about C programming, we recommend starting with the comp.lang.c
FAQ, available at <URL:http://www.eskimo.com/~scs/C-faq/top.html>.

In general, Palm OS programming questions should be posted to palm-dev-forum
or pilot.programmer if they are related to Palm OS APIs etc generally
regardless of the tools in use, or to tools-forum or pilot.programmer.gcc
if they are specifically related to the use of GCC and prc-tools.

For the latter, see also <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/faq/>.

In order to post to palm-dev-forum or tools-forum you first need to subscribe
at <URL:http://www.palmos.com/dev/support/forums/>.  You'll also see several
other fora listed there; like tools-forum, they are more specific than the
general palm-dev-forum and should be used in preference to palm-dev-forum for
questions within their particular areas.

To post to pilot.programmer and pilot.programmer.gcc, just point your
newsreader to <URL:news://news.falch.net/>.  You'll also see several other
newsgroups listed there.

If you haven't participated in technical fora like these before, we also
recommend reading <URL:http://www.tuxedo.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html>,
which will teach you how to present your information and questions so as to
maximise the likelihood of useful responses.


BUILDING FROM SOURCE

To build these tools yourself, you will need to download the source from
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>.  The prc-tools source contains
patches against specific versions of GCC, binutils, and GDB.  You will
also need the source code for these versions of these packages.

See the file BUILDING.html for details.  This file can be found in
the prc-tools source tarball and also on the web at
<URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/install/BUILDING.html>.


LICENSING

* The patches to the GNU tools in *.palmos.diff and the code in the tools
  subdirectory are free software, and may be redistributed and/or modified
  under the terms of the GNU General Public License, either version 2, or
  (at your option) any later version.  See the file COPYING.

* The run-time support code in the crt subdirectory is in the public domain,
  and the resulting object code may be freely linked into your programs.

* The code in the libc subdirectory is redistributable as follows:

  libc.a,
  libc.sa
	Small standard C library (static and shared versions).
	Includes type stuff, printf and friends.  putchar()
	and printf() send output to the LCD (even does scrolling!).
	I would not expect this to be terribly useful for anything
	except debugging, or perhaps a terminal program.  String
	functions are also included, as are memmove, bcopy and
	those sorts of things.  Much of this library thanks to
	Linus Torvalds, from the Linux kernel lib directory.  He
	gave me permission to release this stuff _without_ GPL
	encumbrance.

  [From the prc-tools 0.5.0 README, by Jeff Dionne]

* The code in the libm subdirectory is based on the Cephes Math Library
  <URL:http://www.moshier.net/#Cephes> and is freely redistributable
  as follows:

  libm.a
	Single precision math library.  The standard kind of stuff
	(like multiply, add etc) will be included with libgcc.a
	when the compiler was built, this stuff is what one expects
	from a complete libm.a.  This library was ported from
	the Cephes Math Library Release 2.2:  June, 1992 and is
	Copyright 1984, 1987, 1988 by Stephen L. Moshier.  Really
	neat stuff!

CONTRIBUTORS AND CONTRIBUTING

The original post-linker tools and Palm OS support patches for gcc 2.7.2.2,
binutils 2.7, and gdb 4.16 were written mainly by D. Jeff Dionne, Kresten
Krab Thorup, Ian Goldberg, Keith Packard, and Kenneth Albanowski, with
contributions from many others.

John Marshall ported the patches to recent versions of GCC and binutils.
Peter Trommler ported the gdb patches to 4.17.  Many others have contributed
suggestions, patches, bug reports, and other support; many thanks to

	Kenneth Albanowski, Marc Balmer, Simon Burge, Jesse Donaldson,
	Tom Dyas, Mark W. Eichin, Peter Eisenlohr, Christian Falch,
	Rick Flower, Brian Foley, Lonnie Foster, Ian Goldberg,

The prc-tools project home page is <URL:http://prc-tools.sourceforge.net/>.
Discussion of further prc-tools development and maintenance takes place on
the prc-tools-devel mailing list, accessible via the home page.

(Note that discussion of Palm OS programming problems encountered while
using prc-tools is off-topic on prc-tools-devel; such questions are more
likely to receive knowledgeable answers on the more appropriate fora
listed above under "Questions about Palm OS Programming".)

Happy hacking!
